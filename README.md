This repository includes all code used in the short course. In each sub-directory, you will find three files: (1) a markdown document (README.md) that displays the tutorial for each snippet of code on GitHub; (2) an Rmarkdown document (README.Rmd) that is the tutorial in Rmd format; (3) an R file (ChptX.R) that includes only code and comments.
